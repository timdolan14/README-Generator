## Description 

When creating a project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the application. The README should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. For this project, the User can quickly and easily create a README file by using Node.js and the Inquirer package, all directly within the Terminal. 

## Usage
